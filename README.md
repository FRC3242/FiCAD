# FiCAD

FIRST Inspired Computer Aided Drafting (FiCAD) is a CAD web-based application meant to create electrical mixed scheme drawings for FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Designed and developed by FRC Team 3242 and Forest High Schoolâ€™s Computer Science Club, it is meant to help create team efficiency for FRC teams to help electrical teams implement their systems quickly and efficiently. It also serves as a printing area, so when a team at competition has to rework their electrical systems, they can do so without problems.

The FiCAD Application houses the components (with wires):

- NI roboRIO 2.0 
- Power Distribution Panel  
- Servo Motor 
- Limit switch (VEX) 
- IR Sensor (adafruit) 
- Rev Spark MAX 
- Voltage regulator module 
 
MOTORS: 
775 Pro
775 redline
Neo v1.1
Neo 550
CIM
Snowblower
Kraken X60
Kraken X44

- Pneumatic control module 
- FRC Radio VH109 
- Limelight 
- 120A Breaker (Andymark) 
- ES12 12V Battery 
- On-board compressor 
- AM-2006 Pressure Sensor 
- Solenoid Valve 
- USB Camera 
- Robot Signal Light (am-3583, AndyMark) 
- OM5P Radio (For older robots, pre-2025) 
- Pigeon 2.0 (CTR) 
- Find encoders for each motor, specific to motors 
- Resistors 




	Started with inspiration from the TKO circuit Simulator, we aspired from their creators to develop an application that was more up to date and with more features such as printing to PDF and more.
